## Original Requirements

an AI-powered concept mapping tool that, through a mind-map interface and LLM-driven exploration, enables users to delve deeply into any subject matter, discover relationships between concepts, generate summaries, flashcards, and content, and even convert knowledge into a personal ontology database, all while supporting multiple languages and offering features like Socratic alignment, learning helpers, and dynamic concept linking, with the entire exploration driven by simple button presses rather than complex prompts

## Project Name

ai_concept_mapper

## Product Goals

- Enable deep exploration of subjects through AI-driven concept mapping
- Support multiple languages for a global user base
- Provide intuitive and simple user interactions

## User Stories

- As a user, I want to explore complex topics through a mind-map interface to understand relationships between concepts.
- As a user, I want to generate summaries and flashcards to aid my learning process.
- As a user, I want to convert my knowledge into a personal ontology database for future reference.
- As a user, I want the tool to support multiple languages so I can use it in my preferred language.
- As a user, I want to use simple button presses to navigate and explore concepts without needing to input complex prompts.

## Competitive Analysis

- ConceptMap AI: Offers basic concept mapping but lacks LLM-driven exploration and multi-language support.
- MindMeister: Provides mind-mapping but does not integrate AI for deep exploration or content generation.
- Coggle: Good for collaborative mind-mapping but lacks features like Socratic alignment and personal ontology database.
- Miro: Robust mind-mapping tool with collaboration features but not focused on AI-driven exploration.
- XMind: Offers mind-mapping with some advanced features but does not support dynamic concept linking or multiple languages.

## Requirement Analysis

The tool must leverage AI to facilitate deep exploration of subjects, support multiple languages, and provide an intuitive user experience. Key features include mind-map interface, LLM-driven exploration, content generation, and personal ontology database creation.

## Requirement Pool

- ['P0', 'Develop the mind-map interface']
- ['P0', 'Implement LLM-driven exploration']
- ['P0', 'Support multiple languages']
- ['P1', 'Enable generation of summaries, flashcards, and content']
- ['P1', 'Create personal ontology database functionality']

## UI Design draft

The UI will feature a central mind-map interface with nodes representing concepts. Users can click on nodes to explore further. Simple buttons will allow users to generate summaries, flashcards, and content. Language selection will be available in the settings. The design will be clean and intuitive, focusing on ease of use.

## Anything UNCLEAR

Clarification needed on the specific languages to be supported and the exact nature of 'Socratic alignment' and 'learning helpers'.
